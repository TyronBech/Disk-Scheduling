# Disk Scheduling Programs in COBOL
This repository contains 6 code, each contains 1 algorithm for disk scheduling. These programs are:
* First In First Out
* Look
* C-Look
* Scan
* C-Scan
* Shortest Seek Time First

Those programs created are academic related. Disk scheduling is a Operating System topic about the read
and write process of a disk drive. The algorithms are used to solve for the head movement, seek
time(although not included in the program), and total head movement
